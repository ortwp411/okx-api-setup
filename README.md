To integrate OKX exchange with your trading terminal, you'll need to generate an API key. Here's how to do it step by step.

Head over to the OKX website and log into your account. Click your profile icon in the upper right corner, then select the **API keys** option from the dropdown menu.

Once you're in the API management section, click the **Create APIs** button to start the process.

## Configuring Your API Key Settings

A form will appear asking you to fill in several important fields:

- **API name** â€” Give your key a memorable name so you can identify it later
- **Purpose** â€” Select "API trading" from the options
- **Permissions** â€” Enable trading permissions by checking the Trade box
- **Passphrase** â€” Create a secure passphrase between 6-32 characters (you'll need this later for integration, so save it somewhere safe)

After filling everything out, click **Submit all** to proceed.

The system will ask you to confirm the operation using whatever authentication methods you have connected to your accountâ€”this might be email verification, SMS, or authenticator app.

## Saving Your API Credentials

Once confirmed, you'll see your API information displayed. **This is important**: copy the API Key, Secret Key, and remember your passphrase. Store them somewhere secureâ€”you won't be able to see the Secret Key again after closing this window.

## Connecting Your API to Your Trading Platform

Now that you have your API credentials, it's time to connect them to your trading platform. Open your platform and navigate to **Account** â†’ **Exchange accounts** section, then click **Add new exchange**.



A form will appear where you'll enter your credentials:

- Select OKX from the exchange list
- Enter your API Key
- Enter your Secret Key  
- Enter the passphrase you created earlier
- Give this connection a name for easy reference
